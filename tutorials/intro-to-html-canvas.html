    <h1>Intro to HTML Canvas</h1>
    <p>HTML Canvas is a very powerful tool for all web developers. It's also really easy to learn, and unlocks infinite possibilities - you can make ultra-animated elements, interactive backgrounds, or even full-fledged games!</p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>HTML Canvas is a DOM element, which means it can be included in HTML files manually. It can also be created dynamically, which we'll explore later.</p>
    <p>First we'll create a canvas element by making a new <code>index.html</code> file and adding the following code:</p>
    <div class="code">
        <canvas id="canvas" style="width:10vmin;height:10vmin;"></canvas>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </div>
    <p>We've now created a canvas element! The width and height just tells the browser how big the canvas should be.</p>
    <p>Then, we create a <code>script.js</code> file and reference the canvas.</p>
    <div class="code">const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
        const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
        canvas.width = 100;
        canvas.height = 100;
    </div>
    <p>The way HTML Canvas works is through its <i>context</i>. We called our context ctx in this instance, but you can call it whatever you want. You tell its context what to draw, where to draw, etc.</p>
    <p>We've also defined our canvas' width and height. If we don't do that, our canvas could be 0x0, or something else if the browser chooses.</p>
    <p>Now let's try drawing a rectangle:</p>
    <div class="code">ctx.fillStyle = "white"
        ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        ctx.fillStyle = "red"
        ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 80, 50);;
    </div>
    <p>Looking at <code>ctx.fillRect</code>:</p>
    <p>The first value is the x-coordinate of the top-left corner.</p>
    <p>The second value is the y-coordinate of the top-left corner.</p>
    <p>The third value is the width, and the fourth value is the height.</p>
    <p>The result should be:</p>
    <canvas id="canvas" style="width:10vmin;height:10vmin;"></canvas>
    <p>And there you go! To learn more about HTML canvas, check out these resources:</p>
